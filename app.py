Machine Learning Course - Main Application Entry Point

This is the homepage of the interactive ML course application that serves as the
landing page and navigation hub for all 7 course lessons.

What Students Learn Here:
--------------------------
- How the course is structured (lesson progression)
- Which datasets we're working with (TMDB Movies, NYC Airbnb)
- How to navigate the Streamlit multi-page interface
- What prerequisites and concepts each lesson covers

Technical Notes for Developers:
---------------------------------
Streamlit's multi-page app feature automatically:
1. Scans the pages/ directory for Python files matching pattern N_*.py
2. Creates a sidebar navigation menu in numerical order
3. Makes each file a separate page with isolated state
4. Shares session_state across pages for persistent data

This design pattern separates concerns:
- app.py: Homepage and course overview
- pages/: Individual lesson implementations
- utils/: Shared functionality (data, models, UI components)

# ========================================================================
# PAGE CONFIGURATION
# ========================================================================
# CRITICAL: set_page_config() MUST be the first Streamlit command on any page.
# This configures browser tab title, favicon, and overall layout settings.
# If called after any other Streamlit command, it will raise an error.
#
# Key Options Explained:
# ----------------------
# page_title : str
#     Text displayed in the browser tab/window title bar.
#     Helps users identify the app when multiple tabs are open.
#
# page_icon : str or PIL.Image
#     Icon displayed in the browser tab (favicon).
#     Can be an emoji (like "🎬") or path to an image file.
#     Emojis are simple and work cross-platform without additional files.
#
# layout : str, options=["centered", "wide"]
#     Controls the maximum width of the app content:
#     - "centered" (default): Limits content to ~800px, good for text-heavy apps
#     - "wide": Uses full browser width, excellent for dashboards and visualizations
#
#     We use "wide" because this course has many charts, tables, and side-by-side
#     comparisons that benefit from horizontal space.
#
# Why This Matters:
# -----------------
# Good page configuration improves user experience by:
# 1. Making the app identifiable in browser tabs
# 2. Using screen real estate efficiently
# 3. Setting professional visual standards
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="ML Course",
    page_icon="🎬",
    layout="wide",  # Use full width for better chart visibility
)

# ========================================================================
# MAIN CONTENT: HOMEPAGE / LANDING PAGE
# ========================================================================
# This section serves as the entry point and course overview for students.
#
# Design Philosophy:
# ------------------
# The homepage should:
# 1. Welcome and orient new users
# 2. Explain the course structure and philosophy
# 3. Describe available datasets
# 4. Provide clear navigation guidance
# 5. Set expectations for prerequisites and time commitment
#
# We use Streamlit's markdown support extensively to create rich, formatted
# text that's more engaging than plain text but easier to maintain than HTML.

# Main header - this is the first thing students see
# st.title() renders as an <h1> HTML element with Streamlit's styling
st.title("🎬 Introduction to Machine Learning")

# Main course introduction using markdown for formatting
# Markdown allows: headers (##), bold (**), lists (- or 1.), code (`code`), etc.

## Welcome to the Interactive ML Course!

This application is your hands-on companion for learning machine learning fundamentals.
Instead of just reading about algorithms, you'll **interact** with them, **visualize** how they work,
and **experiment** with real datasets.

### 🎯 Course Philosophy

**Learn by doing, not just reading.** Every lesson includes:
- ✅ Interactive visualizations to build intuition
- ✅ Configurable models to experiment with hyperparameters
- ✅ Real datasets (movies and Airbnb listings) for practical experience
- ✅ Detailed explanations of what's happening under the hood

### 📊 Datasets We Use

We'll explore ML using two real-world datasets:

**1. TMDB 5000 Movies** 🎥
- 5,000 movies with titles, plot summaries, genres, ratings, revenue
- Movie posters (images) for vision-based tasks
- Learn to: search movies by description, classify genres, predict ratings

**2. NYC Airbnb Listings** 🏠
- 5,000 Airbnb listings in New York City
- Descriptions, amenities, neighborhoods, prices, photos
- Learn to: find similar properties, predict prices, classify neighborhoods

**Switch between datasets** using the sidebar dropdown to see how the same ML techniques work on different domains!

### 📚 Course Modules

Use the **sidebar** (← over there!) to navigate to lessons. Here's what you'll learn:

---

#### [Lesson 1: From Text to Numbers (Embeddings)](/Lesson_1_Embeddings)
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- How computers convert text into numerical vectors (embeddings)
- What transformer models are and why they're powerful
- How to visualize 768-dimensional vectors
- Comparing text embeddings vs image embeddings

**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of arrays/vectors

**Key Insight**: Embeddings capture semantic meaning - similar text gets similar numbers!

---

#### [Lesson 2: Vector Space & Retrieval](/Lesson_2_Retrieval)
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Similarity metrics: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product
- Building a semantic search engine using embeddings
- Finding similar items by text description or image
- Nearest neighbor search algorithms

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (Embeddings)

**Key Insight**: Search engines don't just match keywords - they find semantically similar content!

---

#### [Lesson 3: Data Splits (Train/Val/Test)](/Lesson_3_Data_Splits)
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Why we split data into training, validation, and test sets
- How to prevent data leakage
- Analyzing distribution differences across splits
- Creating reproducible random splits

**Prerequisites**: None (foundational concept)

**Key Insight**: To know if your model works, you must test it on data it's never seen!

---

#### [Lesson 4: PCA (Principal Component Analysis)](/Lesson_4_PCA)
**Duration**: 60-75 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Dimensionality reduction: compressing 768 dimensions to 2 or 3
- Training deep autoencoders (non-linear PCA)
- Visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D scatter plots
- Projecting new data into the learned space
- Understanding reconstruction error and bottleneck representations

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (Embeddings), Lesson 3 (Data Splits)

**Key Insight**: Most of the "information" in high-dimensional data lives in a much smaller  space!

---

#### [Lesson 5: MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)](/Lesson_5_MDS)
**Duration**: 60 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- An alternative to PCA that preserves distances instead of variance
- Different distance functions: Euclidean, cosine, correlation
- When to use MDS vs PCA
- Applying MDS to text and image embeddings

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 4 (PCA)

**Key Insight**: PCA finds axes of maximum variance, MDS preserves pairwise distances - different goals!

---

#### [Lesson 6: Genre Classification (Multi-Label)](/Lesson_6_Genre_Classification)
**Duration**: 75-90 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Multi-label classification (one movie → multiple genres)
- Training neural networks with PyTorch Lightning
- Handling class imbalance with weighted loss
- Evaluation metrics: precision, recall, F1 score
- Testing predictions on new custom inputs

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (Embeddings), Lesson 3 (Data Splits)

**Key Insight**: Movies can have multiple genres simultaneously - this is different from single-label classification!

---

---

#### [Lesson 7: Regression (Predicting Values)](/Lesson_7_Regression)
**Duration**: 90+ minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Three types of regression: point estimation, probabilistic (MDN), quantile (SQR)
- When to use each approach
- Handling skewed distributions with log transforms
- Quantifying uncertainty in predictions
- Visualizing predicted probability distributions

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (Embeddings), Lesson 3 (Data Splits)

**Key Insight**: Instead of just predicting a single number, you can predict entire distributions!

---

#### [Lesson 8: Cross-Modal Retrieval](/Lesson_8_Cross_Modal_Retrieval)
**Duration**: 60-75 minutes
**What you'll learn**:
- Mapping text and images to a shared vector space
- Training Dual Encoder models with Contrastive Learning
- Retrieving images from text descriptions (and vice-versa)
- Building a multi-modal search engine

**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (Embeddings), Lesson 2 (Retrieval)

**Key Insight**: By learning a shared space, we can translate between different modalities like text and images!

# ### 🚀 Getting Started

# 1. **Make sure you've processed the data** (see README.md):
#    ```bash
#    python process_data.py          # For TMDB Movies
#    python process_airbnb.py        # For Airbnb Listings (optional)
#    ```

# 2. **Select a lesson from the sidebar** (← look left!)

# 3. **Try both datasets** to see how the same techniques work on different data

# 4. **Experiment!** Change hyperparameters, try different configurations, see what happens

# ### 💡 Tips for Success

# - **Take your time**. Each lesson builds on previous ones.
# - **Experiment freely**. You can't break anything - just reload the page!
# - **Read the explanations**. We explain not just HOW but WHY things work.
# - **Try both datasets**. Seeing the same technique on different data builds intuition.
# - **Use the "Help" hover text** on controls to understand each parameter.

# ### 📖 Need More Background?

# If you encounter unfamiliar concepts:
# - Check the **README.md** for prerequisites and references
# - Each lesson has detailed explanations in markdown sections
# - Code comments explain technical details
# - Try the **scripts/verify_*.py** scripts to test your understanding

# ### ⚠️ Important Notes

# - **First time?** Start with Lesson 1 - each lesson builds on previous concepts.
# - **No data?** You'll see "Data not found" errors. Run the processing scripts first (see README).
# - **Slow training?** Reduce epochs/batch size or use a smaller hidden layer.
# - **Something broke?** Refresh the page. Streamlit state is ephemeral.

# ========================================================================
# SIDEBAR GUIDANCE
# ========================================================================
# Streamlit's Multi-Page App Feature:
# ------------------------------------
# When you run app.py, Streamlit automatically:
# 1. Scans the pages/ directory for files matching the pattern: N_*.py
#    (where N is a number for ordering)
# 2. Creates a navigation sidebar with page links in numerical order
# 3. Extracts page titles from the filenames (converts underscores to spaces)
# 4. Handles routing between pages automatically
#
# The sidebar is created WITHOUT us writing any code for it!
# We just add helpful contextual information below the auto-generated nav.
#
# Why This Design Pattern?
# -------------------------
# - Easy to add new lessons: just create pages/9_New_Lesson.py
# - Automatic ordering: rename files to change sequence
# - Isolated state: Each page has its own namespace but shares st.session_state
# - No routing code needed: Streamlit handles all navigation

# Success message to guide new users to the navigation menu
# The 👆 emoji visually points to where the lesson links appear

# ========================================================================
# FOOTER
# ========================================================================
# Display a consistent footer across all pages using our shared UI component.
#
# Software Engineering Best Practice: DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Instead of copying footer HTML/markdown to every page, we:
# 1. Define the footer once in utils/ui.py
# 2. Import and call display_footer() on each page
#
# Benefits:
# - Single source of truth: Update footer in one place
# - Consistency: All pages guaranteed to have identical footer
# - Maintainability: Easy to add elements like version info or links
# - Testability: Can unit test footer rendering separately
#
# This pattern applies to any UI component used across multiple pages:
# headers, sidebars, data loading patterns, chart configurations, etc.
display_footer()
